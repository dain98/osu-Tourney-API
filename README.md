# osu-Tourney-API

### **UNDER DEVELOPMENT**


This is a public API that any tourney host can use for free (or pretty much anyone else). Accessable at https://osu.zenith.blue/api

This endpoint is rate limited at a ridiculously high 800 requests per minute, so unless you're abusing it you should be good. :)

/users/ - Get specific information about a user!

/tourney/ - Get specific information about a tournament!
